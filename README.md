# Traffic-Sign-Classification
Traffic signs are crucial for road safety and guiding drivers. However, manual recognition can be error-prone, especially for autonomous vehicles. This project aims to automatically detect and classify traffic signs using deep learning, enabling self-driving cars to make accurate, real-time decisions and enhance road safety."
